## **DESCRIPTION**
> Topic Assessed: **SQL** - **Node.js, MYSQL2, db.query, schema, seeds, mysql, console-table, etc.**
### **My Task**
*Employee Tracker* is a content management systems (CMS) that allows a user track and modify the employees of a company.
> Create the application from scratch.
> 
> Create package.json file detailing required dependencies to run the application.
> 
> Create index.js file to launch application file.
>
> Create server.js file that holds the sql database and server information/module.
>
> Organize directories in accordance with standard format (root, lib, db, assets).
>
> Create class called action that utilizes sub modules/classes.
>
> Create individual class for each action view, add, update, and remove.
>
> Create schema.sql, seeds.sql, and query.sql files in db to assist in the development process.
>
> Use external packages such as mysql2, express, inquirer, and console-table-printer.
> 
> **Note**: Used [console-table-printer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console-table-printer) instead of [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)
>
> Completed all **Bonuses** for the application: `Update employee managers`, `View employees by manager`, `View employees by department`, `Delete departments, roles, and employees`, and `View the total utilized budget of a department`.
